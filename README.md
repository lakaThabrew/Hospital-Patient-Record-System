# Hospital Patient Record System
Based on the readers' and writers' problem 
- In a busy hospital, multiple doctors, medical laboratory technicians (MLTs), and nurses must access patient records.
- Doctors can update patient records with diagnoses and prescriptions, while MLTs can provide test results. Nurses can view patient records to administer medications and monitor vitals.
- Doctors and MLTs need exclusive access to records to avoid inconsistencies, while multiple nurses can read simultaneously without conflict.
- The hospital patient record system must ensure that doctors/MTLs don't overwrite while nurses are reading, and none of the parties wait forever to access the system. 

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
